Socialyte 

Socialyte is an events application that aims to make public events, public knowledge.

The problem with many event applications (including the way events are handled on Google+ and Facebook) is that there's no easy way to find all of the public events. How would you go about finding events on your favorite site?

Another issue is that an events application is no good if there aren't any events in the database.

Socialyte solves the two problems above by providing an open database that contains all of the public events of its users. This works by pulling in the Facebook (and soon Foursquare and Google+) events from every user that logs into Socialyte.

Socialyte also takes the position that each user is an event organizer. With that said, you can "Follow" certain users and easily discover events that he/she has created. 

Socialyte is still in the works, but you can check out the foundation at socialyteapp.herokuapp.com!
